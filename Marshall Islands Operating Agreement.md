Changes to Exhibit C will be made in the GitHub copy and will be reported in Exhibit C Original only every ﬁve changes of document version in Exhibit C GitHub Copy (i.e., the following versions will be reported on Exhibit C: V1, V5, V10, etc.). In the case of a discrepancy between Exhibit C Original and Exhibit C GitHub Copy, the version contained in GitHub shall prevail. However, if the GitHub copy version of the Exhibit C will not be, and for whatever reason, anymore available, the version of the Exhibit C contained in Exhibit C Original will be considered the only valid version of the Exhibit C.

Should any Grant Reviewer be temporarily excluded from reviewing a speciﬁc grant proposal for conﬂict of interests, that Grant Reviewer will maintain their oﬃce as Grant Reviewer but will not take part in reviewing and especially voting on that speciﬁc grant proposal. In such cases, the Program Lead will add another Grant Reviewer. The selection of this temporary additional Grant Reviewer shall be based on the results of the Member vote in which the Grant Reviewers have been initially selected, i.e., the next available runner-up candidate based on the vote results: the Program Lead will approach the candidate with the ﬁve highest vote count to act as a Grant reviewer for a speciﬁc proposal temporarily. If this one is unavailable, the Lead will approach the candidate with the 6th highest vote count. The remuneration of this additional temporary Grant Reviewer will be based on the remuneration deﬁned in Exhibit B for Grant Reviewer. Should any Grant Reviewer be permanently unavailable or permanently removed from the Grant Committee as described in the procedures of Exhibit C, a new Grant Reviewer shall be elected by the Company's Members as deﬁned in Exhibit C’s policies.

In that case, the Co-Lead will be compensated for this extra time and can invoice more than 10 hours per week, depending on appropriate time documentation.
