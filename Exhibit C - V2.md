---

## 1.0 Introduction Tangle Community Treasury Grant Committee - Operation Specification

The specification below is the legal, operational document in which the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee and Tangle DAO LLC members shall manage and operate any assets the IOTA and/or the Shimmer community allocates through a purpose-bound governance vote.

## 2.0 Definitions  

In this Agreement: 

**“Committee Members”** The elected members act as program lead, co-lead, and reviewers of the community treasuries grant program. Each community (e.g., the IOTA  or Shimmer community) elects members to represent them to manage the funding allocated to the Tangle Community Treasuries for grant funding. Committee members can represent both communities if both communities elect them.
 
**“IOTA Community”** Within the context of this document the IOTA Community encompassess individuals that have voting power through holding IOTA tokens and whom which can take part in community governance votes.

**“IOTA Community Treasury”** The IOTA Community Treasury consists of 54,896,344 MIOTA (54,89 Ti), which was voted on by the community to “Build” with and create a community treasury to be managed by and for the IOTA Community. The medium article [Burn vs. Build](https://blog.iota.org/community-treasury-vote-final-results/) explains the history and final results of the IOTA community vote.

**“Purpose Bound or Purpose Bound Allocation”** means that the community may decide to form new DAOs or support funding arrangements above and beyond the Tangle Community Treasury  grant program activities and committees. Some decisions may require a legal entity to sign contracts, issue funding, or other unknown reasons. Such a decision by the community would only be completed through a community governance vote, upon which such IOTA and or Shimmer Community funds would be transferred to the Tangle DAO LLC. These funds would be transferred with a specific purpose bound, such as managing a treasury through a committee-led program. However, it can be any legal purpose bound by the communities. The committee, which manages the Tangle DAO LLC, shall govern the assets allocated by the community only for the purpose declared by the governance vote.

**“Shimmer Community”** Within the context of this document the Shimmer Community encompassess individuals that have voting power through holding Shimmer tokens and whom which can take part in community governance votes.

**“Shimmer Community Treasury”** means all currently not yet purpose-bound and therefore unallocated Assets that remain from the initially created 10% supply (181,362,051 SMR) that belong to the Shimmer Token holders (reference: 181,362,051 SMR).

**“Tangle Community“** Within this document, the Tangle Community encompasses individuals with voting power through holding Shimmer and IOTA tokens which take part in community governance votes.  These are communities members that follow or are involved in both the IOTA and Shimmer communities.

**“Tangle Community Treasury”** means assets to include $SMR, $IOTA, or other assets allocated by the IOTA & Shimmer community to be managed by the Tangle DAO LLC. 

**“Tangle Community Treasury Grant Committee”** means the grant committee members elected by the IOTA & Shimmer community through a governance vote to manage the Tangle Community Treasury assets. Specific members may be designated to oversee specific treasuries only or both (e.g., the IOTA Community Treasury funds or the Shimmer Community Treasury funds)

**“Tangle DAO LLC”** means the legal entity formed in The Republic of the Marshall Islands, which offers liability protection to the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee and community. The initial formation of the LLC entity is focused on managing the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee. However, it is not limited to and can act as an entity to manage community assets through purpose-bound allocations. A diagram shows the layout below.

## 3.0 Specification

### _Mission of the Tangle Community Treasury Grant Committee:_

_A community-led and committee-based grant program to support the Shimmer and IOTA network while empowering the ecosystems_

### 3.1 The Committee

The committee will be set up with five members to manage all assests allocated to them by the Shimmer and IOTA community. 

#### 3.1.1 One of the committee members is the *Program Lead*, which, besides reviewing funding requests, takes care of all administrative tasks and reporting and coordinates the committee member’s work for the IOTA and Shimmer community treasury funds.

#### 3.1.1.1 Program leads tasks and responsibilities specific to the operations of the Tangle DAO LLC
- Ensure that Tangle DAO LLC always maintains an operational legal status.
- Ensure any binding governance votes by the community do not task the Tangle DAO LLC to conduct illegal activities or could lead to lose its non-profit status. Any community governance proposal that would incite the LLC to lose its registration or non-profit status will be declined in the initial proposal process. The program lead will be responsible for getting a legal statement from the LLC legal representative and presenting it to the community in case of an dispute about the decline.
- The lead will ensure that all payments invoiced or requests to the Tangle DAO LLC are paid out in a timely manner and accounted for publicly.
- The program lead will ensure that the LLC’s legal documents in the GitHub [Tangle DAO LLC Documentation](https://github.com/Deep-Sea-888/Tangle-DAO-LLC-Documentation) are up-to-date. The lead will also liaise with the LLC legal representative if new legal documents are required.
- The program lead will maintain the www.TangleTreasury.org website and ensure the domain stays active while correcting any process errors promptly.
- The program lead will ensure all committee members and/or consultant hours are tracked seperately between the two community treasuries (IOTA and Shimmer) and shown in the public accounting ledger.
- The program lead act as the signing agent for the Tangle DAO LLC in case the community approves the LLC to bind a contract(s).

#### 3.1.1.2 Program leads tasks and responsibilities specific to the operations of the Tangle Community Treasury grant committees
- The Lead will promote the program, identify directions for funding, and has a thought leadership role in guaranteeing the program’s success.
- The Lead is directly involved in grant reviews and allocates suitable reviewers to work on proposals based on their qualifications and experience. 
- Further, an important part is the ongoing coordination with the second ecosystem funding program run by the Tangle Ecosystem Association and the initiatives of Shimmer Growth Committee to ensure effective alignment in the goals and directions of the community grants program.
- The Lead will organize bi-weekly treasury working meetings for the committees elected by the IOTA and Shimmer communities. Each week, the program lead will schedule a treasury meeting. Each Treasury will share the hours incurred if committee members represent the IOTA and Shimmer community.
- The Lead will promptly and transparently complete all financial and asset accountings while maintaining independent ledgers between the Shimmer and IOTA committees.
- The Lead will complete quarterly transparent reports for each community on how the community funds were used.
- The Lead will act as the first public contact for anyone that wants to approach the committee besides funding requests.
- The Program Lead will be contracted by Marshal Island DAO LLC, which acts as the legal entity of the program and offers limited liability and the needed legal structure to ensure a safe operation.
- To establish this contract, the Program Lead shall have a legal entity (company, LLC, GmbH, etc.) set up in its home jurisdiction to engage in agreements and manage the Tangle DAO LLC. 
- The Lead will be compensated for his time at USD 70 per hour.
- The Tangle DAO LLC will compensate the program lead for a maximum of 40-hours-per-week as a sum of both community treasury committee activities, and both parties will sign a 12-month service provider contract. Compensation will be paid from the respective “Shimmer Committee USDT budget” and “IOTA Committee USDT budget” based on the submitted hours per committee.

#### 3.1.2 The *Grant Reviewers* 

- The grant reviewers are tasked to work on assess and review subnmitted proposals for grant payouts. They do this on the basis of a part-time service provider contract with the Tangle DAO LLC. 
- Each set of committee members (IOTA and Shimmer) operates a 3 of 5 Gnosis multi-signature wallet respective to the community treasury they manage, with a required 3 out of 5 signatures for any operation (like spending funds or adding or removing members).
- The Lead will assign reviewers to work on proposals based on their qualifications, experience, and availability.
- Grant reviewers will operate on a service provider contract with the Tangle DAO LLC. 
- The grant reviewers will be compensated for their time at USD 50 per hour. Compensation will be paid from the respective “Shimmer Committee USDT budget” and “IOTA Committee USDT budget” based on the submitted hours per committee.
- The Tangle DAO LLC will compensate the grant reviewers based on providing a maximum of 10 hours per week, and they will sign a 12-month service provider contract.
- The committee members will select one of the four reviewers as the **Co-Lead**. The Co-Lead acts on behalf of the Committee Lead in cases of sickness, holidays, or leaving. If the lead resigns, the Co-Lead continues the operation and organizes an election of a new Lead through a community vote.
- If the Programm Lead is unavailable/sick/on leave and the Co-Lead needs to fill this position, the Co-Lead will be compensated for this extra time at the same rate the program lead receives at $70 per hour and can invoice up to 40 hrs per week during his time filling in for the program lead.

### 3.2 The Tangle Community Treasury Grant Committee Term

3.2.1 The communities will approve the grant committee through a governance vote annually for 12 months. The term of the approved current or new committee members will start on April 1st, 2024, the day after the current committees term ends. Upon completion of the Phase III governance vote, the committee members elected by their communities will be publicly announced. Each year before the end of the approved operating period (Currently March 2024), the below bullet points describe how decisions shall be made through community governance votes.

- The Shimmer and IOTA shall conduct community votes to renew their respective committees for another year and must include include the request for a new budget allocation from the respective community treasuries so that the program can stay operational. These governance votes shall be initiated a minimum of 6 weeks before the end of the approved periods the committees are authorized to operate.
- The Shimmer and IOTA communities will decide annually to continue or end the Tangle DAO LLC. Only with community independent majority votes between the two communities can the Tangle DAO LLC be closed down or governance decisions be implemented. If both communities do not vote in favor of a change, then the proposal does not pass and is not implemented.
- If both communities decide not to continue the Tangle Community Treasury grant committee or Tangle DAO LLC, the program and/or co-lead will work together to enable a graceful shutdown of operations and transfer all assets back to the community-controlled wallet addresses. If a specific community (e.g., IOTA or Shimmer) wants to discontinue its committee management, it can do so through its community governance vote.
- Further, the program and co-lead will ensure all legal obligations, including documentation, forms signed, and any registration fees or required taxes, are paid, and no legal obligations remain with the Marshall Islands. The Tangle Community Treasury and/or Tangle DAO LLC shall meet any legally bound contractual obligations and outstanding payments, while outstanding approved grants shall be funded by the respective community treasury that has approved that grant. The Tangle DAO LLC shall secure all costs for an operational shutdown before transferring all assets back to the community-controlled address or addresses. Suppose there are non-tokenized assets such as real tangible assets or fiat under Tangle DAO LLC control or bank accounts. In that case, such assets will be transferred back to the community as approved by a community governance vote.
- If the community decides via a governance vote to continue the Tangle Community Treasury and/or Tangle DAO LLC, the program and/or co-lead will support a smooth transition with the current or newly elected committee members.”

#### 3.2.2 The community may replace members during the program’s period through a governance vote following the process described in the [Shimmer Governance Framework](./the-shimmer-governance-framework.md) and [IOTA Governance Framework](to be inputted later her).

- Need for replacements may occur if committee members cannot dedicate sufficient time to the program. If they ask for a replacement for personal reasons, or if the community has valid concerns about the motivation and professionality of a member or has any proof of fraud, betrayal, or violation of terms.
- Grant reviewers are free to leave the position based on the terms stated in their contract. The grant receiver shall give a 4-week notice to the program lead in written form before leaving the committee.
- In case of serious violation of terms of the contract, like a breach of NDA, insider trading, or not disclosed conflict of interest, reviewers will be immediately discarded from the committee position by the program or co-lead and removed as signers of the multi-sig wallet.
- Replacement positions will be offered to the runner-up candidates of the committee selection process (Phase 3 results).

### 3.3 Requirements for Committee Members:

- All committee members will do KYC to reveal and verify their identity and sign a legally binding service provider contract with the Tangle DAO LLC.
- All committee members must reveal potential conflicts of interest before becoming a committee member. They need to indicate if they currently are or have been in the past part of a team in a DLT project or have other connections or affiliations to projects or groups that could cause a conflict of interest. A conflict of interest policy needs to be accepted and signed.
- To ensure a committee structure that provides different views and makes decisions as unbiased as possible, the maximum number of committee members from a Project Team is limited to one member per team. In this sense, a Project Team is defined as any organization that causes a conflict of interest by being affiliated as a team member or earning a salary, payment for services, or commission from the project.
- A committee member cannot be involved in evaluating any proposal that would cause a conflict of interest. Other grant reviewers will handle such cases without involving the member that has the conflict. Conflicts of interest are not exclusion criteria for committee members in general; those conflicts need to be disclosed to the Committee Lead. The Program Lead will then exclude the reviewer from the decision-making process for specific grants that would cause a conflict of interest.
- The Programm Lead is prohibited from holding any other paid position within a Crypto project.
- All members will sign NDAs and Insider Trading disclosures.
- All Committee members are required to operate the Gnosis Multi-Signature Wallet with a Ledger Nano or similar device.

### 3.4 Selection process for committee members and the Program Lead:

Each year to be finalized before March 31st, each community shall have elections and vote for the committee members to represent their community treasury. Acting committee members will choose to submit their nominations or decline the election process for the next year. The election process will follow each communities specifications.
- [The selection process specification](https://govern.iota.org/t/community-grant-committee-selection-proccess-specification/1436)

### 3.5 Committee Right to Request For Proposal 

When time passes in which the committee lacks receiving grant proposals for specific areas that support the positive growth of the ecosystem, the committees may issue an RFP (Request For Proposal). The below guidelines shall be followed when submitting RFPs.
- The committee can post an RFP (Request for Proposal) on the Tangle Community Treasury website.
- The committee shall promote the RFP through its Twitter account and the IOTA/Shimmer Discord and other community communication channels.
- The committee can consult and involve the community to develop RFPs.
- The RFP must be open and public for a minimum of 30 days.
- The committee will post all proposals under review that are submitted to the RFP transparently on the website.
- The committee must review all proposals submitted from the RFP fairly and unbiasedly.

## 4.0 Guiding principles for funding decisions:

1. A proposal must be relevant to the Shimmer and/or IOTA network and its ecosystem.
2. A proposal shall not segregate individuals, organizations, or communities based on sex, race, color, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority or majority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation.
3. The committee will prioritize projects with the highest potential and positive impact on the ecosystem compared to the received funding.
4. The proposer or team must be capable of delivering the proposed project. Evaluating this is the responsibility of the committee.
5. All funded projects must be open source (under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) or [Apache 2.0 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)). Projects in development must allow the grant committee to access any private repos for review. These projects will only receive 50% of the grant payment until they fully open-sourced their code.
6. The requested budget must match industry standards for comparable tasks. If a proposal requests way above fair market value, the committee will dialogue with the team to request adjustments. The committee may reject the proposal or cut the funding to settle at fair market value.
7. If a project has already received funding from the Tangle Ecosystem Association or other grant funding programs, it cannot receive funding from the Tangle Community Treasury for the exact scope of work. But, the grant committee can grant additional funding for extensions or further developments of such a project.
8. A proposal that creates any conflict of interest for committee members must be reported to the committee lead. Committee members with conflicts of interest shall not process, comment, or vote on a proposal.
9. Any attempts of Bribery or the offer of future payments, token distribution, or compensations/gifts of any form to committee members will immediately cancel a proposal process. Accepted bribes by committee members will lead to the immediate removal of the members from the committee.

## 6.0 Application and approval process:

Easy and quick access to funding is essential to a successful grant program. Numerous examples in the space have shown that this is one of the most critical reasons teams consider when choosing a network.

### 6.1 Funding Tiers and Requirements:

The funding tiers will be approved through annual community votes. The below tiers shall be followed for the IOTA and Shimmer community funds.

- **Tier 1 - up to 5.000 USD**: Two reviewers handle the proposal and approve or decline it. KYC is required for one member of the project teams (the Grant submitter needs to do KYC and be a signer). The reviewers will decide based on the provided data in the application and especially consider if the submitter has a positive history in our community.
- **Tier 2 - Regular Tier 5.000 - 50.000 USD**: Two reviewers review the proposal. KYC is required for one member of the project teams (the Grant submitter needs to do KYC and be a signer). Projects considered to be approved can be invited to conduct a 1-hour interview with the reviewers of the proposal. A minimum of two milestones will be defined, and payments will happen based on these milestones. After completing the KYC process, the committee can pay up to 50% of the requested funding upfront.
- **Tier 3: Regular Tier 50.000 - 200.000 USD**: Same requirements as the previous tier apply. The Project Team must do KYC (3 members do KYC, including the Grant submitter and Project Team Lead, that will be the signer and the 3rd Person decided by the Grant Committee Lead). Additionally, applications need approval by the entire grant committee. Projects considered to be approved will be invited to present the idea in an extensive live interview with two grant reviewers and the Program Lead. A minimum of three milestones are defined, and payments happen based on these milestones.

  If the project is accepted, the Program Lead will assign one of the reviewers as a project steward. The steward is responsible for keeping close contact and doing regular (minimum every two weeks) checks with the project team. Milestones are reviewed by the steward and approved by the committee lead. After completing the KYC process, the program can pay 30% of the requested funding upfront.

- **Tier 4: Regular Tier 200.000 - 500.000 USD:** The entire grants committee will review those applications—same procedure as in Tier 3. The Project Team must do KYC (3 members do KYC, including the Grant submitter and Project Team Lead, that will be the signer and the 3rd Person decided by the Grant Committee Lead). If the project receives funding, the final decision will happen in a **vote by all token holders**.
  - Suppose the grants committee supports that the community shall fund a Tier 4 application; it forwards this application to the community as a proposal in the governance forum and asks for approval by the community in a vote by all Shimmer token holders.
  - The committee lead will submit the proposal in the governance forum and includes the project team’s full proposal and a detailed statement by the grant committee on why it recommends funding this proposal. Such a proposal will enter the governance process as a Phase 2 Poll in the Governance Forum.

### 6.2 Application and scoring process

Grant submitters shall complete the online [web form](https://airtable.com/appx7Gub4vER8KPMV/shr6LF9o6jNAOgIbm) on www.TangleTreasury.org. In addition to the submittal form, grant submitters should also submit the proposal as an attached document. The committee provides a [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1thG3OukVMz9UMxlWHGMdUfmMizI0n1iA/edit) for any submitters that don’t have a custom form themselves.

#### Grant evaluation scoring system:

Grant reviewers will use a scoring system to evaluate funding proposals. The below matrix shall be used to assess the grant and its respective community treasury it was submitted to.

| **Scoring Qualities**                         | Summary                                                                                                                                                     | **Guiding Questions**                                                                                                                                                                              | **Rating**                                                                                                                         |

A project should reach a particular score to be eligible for certain funding Tiers:

- **Tier 4** (Funding budget 200.000 - 500.000 USD) - required score *minimum 17 of 20*
- **Tier 3** (Funding budget 50.000 - 200.000 USD) - required score *minimum 15 of 20*
- **Tier 1 & 2** (Funding up to 50.000 USD) - required score *minimum 13 of 20*

### 6.3 Possible Extra Scoring Points:

- Projects that offer 0,5% of the project’s total token supply to the community Treasury: *One extra point can be granted.*
- Projects that offer 1% of the total token supply to the community Treasury: *Two extra points can be granted.*
- Projects that offer more than 1,5% of the project’s total token supply to the community Treasury: *Three extra points can be granted.*

*This does not imply that automatically such an offer will lead to granting the extra points. Granting these additional points is decided on a case-by-case basis.*

The scoring system is a guideline for reviewers. It may only sometimes apply to some kinds of projects.

We reserve the ability to place specific projects into different tiers even if point scoring disagrees. Still, this scoring system should apply to the majority of projects.

### 6.4 Grant Acceptance Contract Criteria

The committees shall have all grant receivers sign a grant receiver agreement for approved grants before funding. The agreements can be found in the [Tangle DAO LLC repository](https://github.com/Tangle-Community-Treasury-DAO/Tangle-DAO-LLC-Documentation) linked in the Tangle Community Treasury DAO Github. The committee and program lead shall make contracts with the legal representative specific to the grant submission. Such grant contractual frameworks may be but are not limited to the following.
- Standard grants that do not require repayment.
